# i18n

The component is localized entirely in English by default, but you can override these localizations via the `translation` prop - a function that has a signature compatible with the `t` function of i18next. You only need to localize parts of the UI that you'll actually be using, there is no need to localize the entirety of the editor unless you need to. If you're using i18next, you can use browse the [`locales` directory in GitHub](https://github.com/mdx-editor/editor) for a default set of translations or use a tool like [i18next Parser](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-parser) to extract them from the source code. If you're using another i18n library, you can use the `translation` prop to pass in your own translations

```tsx

function LocalizedEditor() {
  return <MDXEditor translation={(key, defaultValue, interpolations) => { return i18n.t(key, defaultValue, interpolations) }} />
}
```
